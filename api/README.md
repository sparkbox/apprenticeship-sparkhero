# SparkHero API

Hey, what are you doing in here? Feel free to take a look around but the exercise of working on SparkHero won't require you to make any changes here. But in case you're wondering, the API runs on [Netlify serverless functions]. In order to run these locally on dev, we run the APIs through the Netlify CLI on a dedicated port and use Webpack proxying to tie it all together. Once deployed on Netlify, however, the APIs are managed exclusively by Netlify.
